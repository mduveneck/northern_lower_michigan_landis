In this folder are climate inputs for the pnet-to-landis tool in monthly format. It is possible that these are actually outputs from the pnet tool that summarized the climate inputs.  The .clm file extensions can be changed to .txt to see them.
These include the three climate scenarios used for the analysis: PCP B1, gfdl A1FI, and current (static or historical) climate.
For each climate scenario, there are 9 separate climate region files.

Also included in this folder is the PnETforlandis-II user guide.
