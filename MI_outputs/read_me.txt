Within the MI_outputs folder, separate sceneario folders exist for each scenario. Within the scenario folders, there is a "Biomass-succession-log.csv" file for each scenario. Fields include (copied from Biomass Succession Manual):

There are six columns of data, listed below.  
6.1.1	Time
The simulation time step
6.1.2	Ecoregion
The ecoregion reported.  Columns 4-6 are ecoregion averages for the time step.
6.1.3	NumSites
The number of active sites per ecoregion.  This column allows rapid calculations of totals as columns 4-6 are area adjusted.
6.1.4	LiveB
The total aboveground live biomass (g m-2) averaged across all sites in the ecoregion.
6.1.5	AG_NPP
The total aboveground biomass net primary productivity (g m-2 yr-1) averaged across all sites in the ecoregion.
6.1.6	LitterB
The total aboveground litter biomass (g m-2) averaged across all sites in the ecoregion.  Dead woody biomass is not included.
